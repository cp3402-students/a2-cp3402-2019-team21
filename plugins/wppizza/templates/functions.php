	if you want to organise your wppizza filter/action customisations 
	separately from your themes functions.php, you could use this file
		
	Note: this file DOES NOTHING unless copied to your theme/child theme directory 
	
	Furthermore, all editable and customised templates/files (including this one) have to reside in 
	a subdirectory of your (child)theme named "/wppizza" to be read 	
	
	so the structure for this file to be read would have to be [path to {child} theme]/wppizza/functions.php]

	However, user-defined CONSTANTS will have to be added to your wp-config.php though
