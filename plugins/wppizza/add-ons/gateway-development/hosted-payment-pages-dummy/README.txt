wppizza-gateway-dummypayhpp.zip

a skeleton gateway you can use for your own gateway development for 
payment processors that use  own hosted payment pages (i.e a redirect)


unzip the file somewhere and read the comments in the files

generally speaking :
	
	replace all Dummypayhpp, DUMMYPAYHPP, , dummypayhpp etc with an appropriate unique identifier for your gateway (including directory and file names). 
	
	So if your gateway is called "Xyz - We Pay U" use perhaps somethig like "Xyzwepayu", "XYZWEPAYU" and "xyzwepayu" ($gatewayName however can be set to the actual name i.e "Xyz - We Pay U" )
	
	you must edit all files (some more than others). 
	
	please read the comments and see the examples in each file
	
	
have fun
